# A modern approach to the end-to-end bilingual handwriting text recognition on the example of russian school notebooks

## Abstract
In repository we provide our approach to the end-to-end bilingual handwriting text recognition. Our solution was developed within the framework of the NTO AI Olympics 2022 and was awarded a prize of $10,000. The dataset presented in the competition consisted of school notebooks, which contained texts in Russian and English. The goal was to first detect the words on the sheet and then recognize the text in them.
